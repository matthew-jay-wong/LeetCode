 * <p>
 *     A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
